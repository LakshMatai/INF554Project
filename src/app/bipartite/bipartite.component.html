	Air transport is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transportation_in_the_United_States#Passenger">second highest</a>
	 mode of transportation in the United States <i>(second to Highway)</i>.  It's no wonder that statistics on flight performance 
	 is collected.  A flight's on-time performance can be affected by delays, fight cancellations and diversions.  Delays can 
	 be categorized into:&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>Air Carrier.</b> The cause was within the airline's control 
	(e.g. maintenance or crew problems, aircraft cleaning, baggage loading, fueling, etc.).&nbsp;&nbsp;
	 <b>Extreme Weather</b> such as tornado, blizzard or hurricane. &nbsp;&nbsp;
	<b>National Aviation System (NAS)</b>  which refers to a broad set of conditions, such as non-extreme 
	weather conditions, airport operations, heavy traffic volume, and air traffic control.&nbsp;&nbsp;
	 <b>Late-arriving aircraft</b> where a previous flight with same aircraft arrived late, causing the present 
	 flight to depart late.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Security</b> caused by evacuation 
	 of a terminal or concourse, re-boarding of aircraft because of security breach, inoperative screening equipment 
	 and/or long lines in excess of 29 minutes at screening areas.  For more details, see 
	 <a href='http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/help/aviation/html/understanding.html'>RITA -Understanding flight delays 
	 and cancellations.</a>
    <br><br>
	From January 2014 to August 2015, majority of delays is caused by Late-Arriving Aircraft, followed by NAS and Air Carrier.
	Extreme weather, which is widely broadcasted, is one of the lowest cause of delay.   Note that there is another category of
	weather within NAS that could have been prevented with proper management.  So, it is surprising that 
	<a href="http://www.rita.dot.gov/bts/help/aviation/html/understanding.html#q8">NAS</a> consistently
	contribute to a high percentage of delay when these delays can be corrected by the airports and the Federal 
	Aviation Administration.  In another note, among the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_airlines_in_North_America">
	4 major airlines in the U.S.</a>, Southwest Airlines (WN) got the lowest performance for 10 months, followed by United Airlines (UA)
	for 6 months.  On the airport side, inspite of being the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_busiest_airports_in_the_United_States">busiest 
	airport</a>, Atlanta Airport did not get the lowest performance at all.
	<br><br>
	<i>  
	  Count is in thousands unit. <b>Total flight</b> is the sum of <i>on-time flight</i> and delays (i.e. aircraft, nas, 
	 weather, late, security), 	cancellations and diversions.  <b>% of Total Flights</b> is the percentage of that 
	 delay/cancellation/diversion against the total flight for that carrier, airport or overall total flight for that year and month.
